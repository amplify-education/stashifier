# This script performs a complete build of the egg,
# creating a virtualenv, installing dependencies,
# linting and running tests, then publishing to the Pynest
# and (optionally) creating an RPM.
#
# It is intended to be run on the Jenkins server,
# but can be run locally as well.
#
# On the Jenkins server, the environment variables below
# will have been set. In a local build, they are set
# to reasonable values.
#
# The only env variable you must set yourself for a
# local build is WG_RPMBUILD, which should point
# to the location of wg_rpmbuild.py, from rpmtools
